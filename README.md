# horiseon-

Horiseon is a cutting edge marketing agency looking to improve the website files for a better readability and flow. Using HTML 5 rules we assigned the new semantic rules to better locate and understand the site. In CSS we were able to condensed the lines to not repeat the same elements by assigning it all under matching elements. Last we gave the site a title for brand awareness and recognition when prospects visit the site.
